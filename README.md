# Tablut
Tablut is one of the family of tafl (or hnefatafl) games: Nordic and Celtic strategy games played on checkered boards between two asymmetric armies. In this project I have implemented the logic for the game and a GUI. There is a one player mode, where you play against the computer. Thus, there is an AI class where I implement an AI for the game. The algorithm for the AI uses the minimax algorithm. I have analysed the board for to come up with a heuristic where every piece is trying to do something different in different stages of the game. The speed of the AI is based on iterative deepening.
